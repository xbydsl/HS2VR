TO DO LIST 2023-09-08
----------------------------------------------

Fix controllers movement in seated mode
  the movement is reset to previous position after grip is released


Enable & test save thumbnail camera working

Hide head when inside head
  to test. worked in KKS_VR

Fix startup first mode "broken"
	lots of things messed up (controller markers etc)
	probably need more time before invoking some of the init routines (which one?)
	kks_vr code for waiting for ready status do not work on older VRGIN

Hide/show controllers with XML setup/key/button

Fix some keys not working sometimes (space, Q etc)
	only when starting in standing mode?
	inherited from HS2VR probably
	try to start in Seated, and check for Settings on scene load

Bugs?
	joystick doesn't work - should do mouse scroll on GUI apparently
	mirror fix doesn't work
	load/save hooks fov is too open, and the camera jumps around after saving/loading
	if last execution used different screen resolution, GUI will not be usable. it's fixed with one restart. bug coming from older HS2VR.
	privacy screen turns GUI black, unusable in Studio, switched off in Studio. Main game not tested
	CapturePanorama disabled, not tested yet


----------------------------------------------
TO DO / longer term list
----------------------------------------------

Enable HS2 main game VR mode
  choose approach - two dll as KKS_VR or just one as OrangeSpork/HSVR2
  check official VR game and KKS_VR for possible additional functionality
  test!!

Show hand instead of controller 
  no tracking, just replace the controller 3d model

Add Warp function in Studio
  keep Studio with just one tool, bind Warp to two button press maybe
  or fast movement with joystick

Enable and test VR panorama screenshot camera

Remove unused references and libs

Keyboard shortcut to enable/disable boop collider
  could be annoying 

Make boop collider smaller
  too much deformation

Add new settings to XML file handler
  voicedistance
  new seated-wtih-controls mode

Check impersonation/POV functionality
  compare KKS_VR and HS2VR, implement

Enable hand track (OpenXR)

Implement privacy mode
  current privacy mode makes the GUI a black rectangle, unusable at least in Studio

Capture VR180 video
  complex! only if there is any code ready to adapt

----------------------------------------------
DONE
----------------------------------------------

Fix grip control for objects!
  most important of all

Port DeviceLegacy?
  seems not necessary - controllers work with grip/move menu

Fix size of gizmo spheres
  they are small and hidden in chara body
  (not needed to fix finally)

Fix GUI laser not showing

Create a new "seated with controllers" mode

Fix Q not showing/hiding gizmos

Fix mouse camera movement blocked
  at VRCameraMoverHelper - it was designed for StandingMode only

Fix light source
  it was an XML option already - change directional light for head spotlight


Fix objects moving to 0,0,0 sometimes when switching seated/standing modes
  shortcut Ctrl-C already taken, pick another
